# Project Title

 Creating and minting token.

## Description
Here we have created our own token using the standard ERC20 token.


## Getting Started

First,we have created a contract that is inherited from ERC20,ERC20Burnable and Ownable.
Then we have created a token that can only be minted by the owner and burned and transferred by any user.
We have only created mint function in this contratct.
The burn and transfer functions are the built-in functions of ERC20 Token.
